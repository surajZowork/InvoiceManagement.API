# Invoice Management System (ASP.NET Core 8 + React TS)

A simple starter project for managing invoices.  
It supports:

- **Backend API (ASP.NET Core 8 + EF Core + FluentValidation)**  
  - Create invoices (with multiple line items)  
  - List invoices with paging, sorting, filtering (customer name + date range)  
  - Retrieve invoice by ID  

- **Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)**  
  - Search invoices by customer name, start date, end date  
  - Paging + sorting  
  - Create invoices via full form or inline quick-add  

---
